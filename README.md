Consensus matrix of direct translations obtained with different MT tools (TPs on row and columns, number of common TCs in cells). The heatmap illustrates the number of FSNs direct translations that are found by any of two given TPs. Barplots on top and left represent the average concordance of one TP with all the others.

Consensus matrix using all the 91 TPs.

PCA of the consensus matrix. Data is related to TCs of the SNOMED Starter Set, obtained by a MTP approach. The ellipses represent the areas that contain 95% of the TPs related to that engine. The higher concordance between Google and Deepl is confirmed by the intersection among Google (green) and Deepl (red) ellipses. The substantial separation of Systran individuals (blue) is an indication of a high amount of peculiar TCs found only by this engine.
