Supp. Fig. 1 (PCA_overall.pdf)

PCA of the consensus matrix. Data is related to TCs of the SNOMED Starter Set, obtained by a MTP approach. The ellipses represent the areas that contain 95% of the TPs related to that engine. The higher concordance between Google and Deepl is confirmed by the intersection among Google (green) and Deepl (red) ellipses. The substantial separation of Systran individuals (blue) is an indication of a high amount of peculiar TCs found only by this engine.
